# ðŸ¤· Absolute intro to coding

Stuck with what to learn to, what order to learn it and how things fit together in the world of tech? This guide is for you.

## Tech departments

Below are some departments or careers within tech, what they do or are responsible for and how they relate or differ from each other.

These descriptions are very simplified but aims to give info someone starting out with a tech career, or someone with a business background to wants to understand their tech colleagues better or pick a technology to learn.

### Data Science

- Data Scientists deal with **pulling** in data from a variety of data sources which might be things like text or CSV files, images, survey answers, external API data (Google Ad spend, social media mentions) and internal database data (such marketing data or customer or sales data).
- A lot of the work is often **processing** the data - understanding the structure and cleaning it so it is consistent and easy work with.
- Data Scientists create reports from the data so that they can make sense of it and give recommendations, or they make the data available for other departments to use. Output might be a CSV, a web report or dashboard, graphs, a PDF or an email report.
- With Data Science, you might also find more specialized positions like Data Engineers or Data Analysts.
- A Data Scientist may be required to make predictions using graphs or statistical techniques, such as using existing data to make a forecast on future performance, grouping customers into categories or recommending products to customers.
- A Data Scientist typically learns some of the following:
	- Stats software 
		- These have a visual interface and produce graphs and reports and some programming skills may be needed to run scripts.
		- For example: Stata, Statistica
		- [List of Statiscal Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_statistical_software)
	- Dashboarding tools
		- For example: Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau, Google Data Studio
	- Scripting languages
		- [R](/Scripting\ languages/R)
		- [Python](/Scripting\ languages/Python)

### Artificial Intelligence

- Within Data Science


## Roadmaps

If you know you want to become a developer or get grow into a less familiar area, these roadmaps can help you pick a direction so that you cover the fundamentals first and become well-rounded.

### Notes

The roadmaps can get long and detailed, but pick starting point and few steps after it and then you can it is not so overwhelming. You also don't have to be an expert in a topic before moving onto the next.

Sometimes you can learn a few topics at once when topics complement each other e.g. HTML + CSS, or HTML + JavaScript.
