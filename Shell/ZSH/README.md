## Setup

### How to install

[source]([Installing ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH))

- macOS
    ```sh
    brew install zsh
    ```
- Debian/Ubuntu
    ```sh
    sudo apt install zsh
    ```
### Try it out

Use ZSH _without_ setting it as your default shell.

Be sure to start a shell in a way that replaces the current shell i.e. This command will kill the old process and start a new one, ignoring any history of commands and configured values.

Use the `exec` command with the `--login` flag so the shell acts as if invoked by login. [source](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Invoking-Bash.html)


```sh
# Switch.
exec -l zsh
# Revert.
exec -l bash
```

### Set ZSH as default

```sh
chsh -s $(which zsh)  # this should resolve to /bin/zsh
```

### Uninstall

#### Option A - just ZSH

Remove ZSH config.

```sh
rm ~/.zshrc
```

Set Bash as default shell.

```
chsh -s $(which bash)
```

Uninstall ZSH.

- macOS
    ```sh
    brew uninstall zsh --force
    ```
- Debian/Ubuntu
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get --purge remove zsh
    ```

#### Option B - Uninstall Oh my ZSH

Run this command on the command-line. It will remove itself and revert your previous bash or zsh configuration.

```sh
uninstall_oh_my_zsh
```
