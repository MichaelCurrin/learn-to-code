For JavaScript, see [link](</Scripting%20languages/JavaScript/README.md>).

## Tools

- HTML table generator.
    - https://divtable.com/table-styler/ - This has an easy GUI and outputs HTML and CSS. Even if you don't use the entire output, it is still useful to pick pieces that you need.

- Markdown table generator.

## IDE extensions

### VS Code

- Formatting - these work great for making HTML and JS look neat and all your files consistently spaced.
    - Beautify - I found memory leaks with this on saving an HT<L file. VS Code would take up around 90% memory when there is a comment in the HTML.
    - Prettier
