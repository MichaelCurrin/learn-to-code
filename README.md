# Learn to Code
> Tutorials and scripts around old and new programming languages to keep track of what I've learnt and to share with others

Improve your coding skills in various languages by going through the content of this repo. I document topics here as I learn and explore, so that I have an easy reference or how-to guide for myself, or in case anyone else might benefit. If you want to contribute, I welcome any corrections or enhancements.

Each language folder has a README explaining how to get the language setup on your machine. There will be a mix of tutorials and/or executable scripts.

### Design patterns

> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)

- [Design Patterns](/Scripting%20languages/Python/README.md#design-patterns) in Python.
- [Design Patterns in Java Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/index.htm) on Tutorials Point website - the the patterns listed on the sidebar menu there.

### Roadmaps

Don't know where to start? Pick a roadmap (learning path) based on your chosen direction.

### Rosetta code

The [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/) website provides tasks solved in various languages for easy comparison. This can be useful whether you are a new or familar with a language. The examples here tend to be minimal and follow a similar pattern, for example if you understand what the Python one is doing you can make sense of the equivalent logic in Ruby or PHP.

Topics:

- [Hello world text](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Text)
- Web
    - [Web server](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Web_server) hello world
    - [Web scraping](https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Web_scraping)
    - [HTTPS/Auth](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/HTTPS/Authenticated)
