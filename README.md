# Learn to Code
> Tutorials and scripts around old and new programming languages to keep track of what I've learnt and to share with others

_Author: Michael Currin_

Improve your coding skills in various languages by going through the content of this repo. I document topics here as I learn and explore, so that I have an easy reference or how-to guide for myself, or in case anyone else might benefit. If you want to contribute, I welcome any corrections or enhancements.
