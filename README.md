# Learn to Code
> Tutorials, scripts, code snippets and resources to help you learn about various languages and become a better dev

Improve your coding skills in various languages by going through the content of this repo. I document topics here as I learn and explore, so that I have an easy reference or how-to guide for myself, or in case anyone else might benefit. If you want to contribute, I welcome any corrections or enhancements.

## ‚å® Language-specific guides

See the folders in this repo to learn about a language such as JavaScript or Python. Each has a README file, with with instructions to install and run the language and links to resources. Some include tutorials or scripts to run locally.

## üìö Resources

[Resources](/resources.md) for learning concepts in programming, with some links.

## üåê Recommended websites

Links I enjoy and would like share.

### üõ† Tools

- [Git Pod](https://gitpod.io) - A free cloud-based IDE that runs Github repos. Edit code with a VS Code editor, run in the terminal and save your changes to Github. Also includes a way to view and manager Pull Requests. Runs in a container environment and can be configured with a Git Pod file in your repo.
- [Python Anywhere](https://pythonanywhere.com) - Free Python hosting. Includes web server with easy configuration along with a MySQL database if you need. Run cron jobs, edit files editing and use consoles for Python, Bash and SQL.
- [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Free hosting for static sites built with Jekyll or plain HTML
- [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) - Edit markdown files on Github using your browser. 
    - The editor makes it easy to apply formatting using buttons rather than typing it up. It includes a preview alongside the edit view, unlike Github's editor which switches between edit and preview modes. 
    - Edit and sync files on the following platforms
        - Dropbox
        - Github - When you link these, you can choose to include or exclude private repo access.
        - Gitlab
        - Google Drive
    - How to edit a repo:
        1. Go to [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/). You will start at a welcome page.
        2. Sign in with Github.
        3. From the menu on the right, select Workspaces.
        4. Select "Add a Github workspace".
        5. Enter a repo path. Optionally set folder path and branch.
        6. You will see your folder tree on the left. Note that files will give a data error initially while content is being pulled in.
        7. Edit files. You do not have to press save - changes will be saved and synced for you and these will appear as commits in Github.
        8. You may add more repos using steps above and then switch between then.
    - Usage notes:
	    - The `.md` extension will be hidden.
	    - Although the Welcome file shows in the tree, it is not actually stored in the repo. You can delete it from the editor view, but it can be useful to keep open as a quick reference.
	    - For help, select Table of Contents from the menu on the right.
	    - Auto sync defaults to 90 seconds and the minimum is 60 seconds.
	    - Click Settings in the right menu. You can override default settings. 
	    - Use `CTRL+SHIFT+V` to paste without formatting - I found this necessary to avoid unnecessary open lines when copying code from an IDE into a markdown codeblock. Or create, the codeblock _first_ and then paste into it as that works fine. When not using a codeblock, you may want to keep the pasted line breaks, as the double spacing is needed for line breaks to render in Markdown.
