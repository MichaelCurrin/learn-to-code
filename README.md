# Learn to Code
> Tutorials, scripts, code snippets and resources to help you learn about various languages and become a better dev

Improve your coding skills in various languages by going through the content of this repo. I document topics here as I learn and explore, so that I have an easy reference or how-to guide for myself, or in case anyone else might benefit. If you want to contribute, I welcome any corrections or enhancements.

## ‚å® Language-specific guides

See the folders in this repo to learn about a specific language.

Some highlights:

- [JavaScript](/Scripting\ languages/JavaScript)
- [Python](/Scripting\ languages/Python)
- [Bash](/Shell/Bash)
- [Git](/Version\ control/Git)

Each section has a README file, with instructions to install and run the language locally and some links to external resources. Some folders include tutorials or scripts to run locally if you clone this repo.

## üìö Resources

- [Resources](/resources.md) - for learning concepts in programming. Includes some external links.

## üåê Recommended

- [Recommended](/recommended.md) - External links I enjoy and would like share with others.
