# Learn to Code
> Tutorials, scripts, code snippets and resources to help you learn about various languages and become a better dev

Improve your coding skills in various languages by going through the content of this repo. I document topics here as I learn and explore, so that I have an easy reference or how-to guide for myself, or in case anyone else might benefit. If you want to contribute, I welcome any corrections or enhancements.

## ‚å® Language-specific guides

See the folders in this repo to learn about a language such as JavaScript or Python. Each has a README file, with with instructions to install and run the language and links to resources. Some include tutorials or scripts to run locally.

## üìö Resources

[Resources](/resources.md) for learning concepts in programming, with some links.

## üåê Recommended websites

Links I enjoy and would like share.

### üõ† Tools

- [Git Pod](https://gitpod.io) - A free cloud-based IDE that runs Github repos. Edit code with a VS Code editor, run in the terminal and save your changes to Github. Also includes a way to view and manager Pull Requests. Runs in a container environment and can be configured with a Git Pod file in your repo.
- [Python Anywhere](https://pythonanywhere.com) - Free Python hosting. Includes web server with easy configuration along with a MySQL database if you need. Run cron jobs, edit files editing and use consoles for Python, Bash and SQL.
- [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Free hosting for static sites built with Jekyll or plain HTML
- [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) - Edit markdown files on Github using your browser. The editor makes it easy to apply formatting using buttons rather than typing it up. It includes a preview alongside the edit view, unlike Github's editor which switches between edit and preview modes.
