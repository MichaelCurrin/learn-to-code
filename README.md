# Learn to Code
> Tutorials, scripts, code snippets and resources to help you learn about various languages and become a better dev

Improve your coding skills in various languages by going through the content of this repo. I document topics here as I learn and explore, so that I have an easy reference or how-to guide for myself, or in case anyone else might benefit. If you want to contribute, I welcome any corrections or enhancements.

## ⌨ Language-specific guides

See the folders in this repo to learn about a language.

Highlights:

- [JavaScript](/Script
- Python

Each has a README file, with instructions to install and run the language locally and some links to external resources. Some folders include tutorials or scripts to run locally.

## 📚 Resources

- [Resources](/resources.md) - for learning concepts in programming, with some links.

## 🌐 Recommended

- [Recommended](/recommended.md) - External links I enjoy and would like share with others.
