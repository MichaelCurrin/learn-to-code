# Learn to Code
> Tutorials and scripts around old and new programming languages to keep track of what I've learnt and to share with others

_Author: Michael Currin_

Improve your coding skills in various languages by going through the content of this repo. I document topics here as I learn and explore, so that I have an easy reference or how-to guide for myself, or in case anyone else might benefit. If you want to contribute, I welcome any corrections or enhancements.

Each language folder has a README explaining how to get the language setup on your machine. There will be a mix of tutorials and/or executable scripts.

## Test Driven Development

If you are interested in writing unit tests for a language, you might find some bootstrap code here: [kata-bootstraps](https://github.com/swkBerlin/kata-bootstraps).
