# Learn to Code
> Tutorials, scripts, code snippets and resources to help you learn about various languages and become a better dev

Improve your coding skills in various languages by going through the content of this repo. I document topics here as I learn and explore, so that I have an easy reference or how-to guide for myself, or in case anyone else might benefit. 

If you want to contribute, I welcome any corrections or enhancements.
