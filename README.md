# Learn Python

Author: Michael Currin

Improve your Python skills! Run the [scripts](learn-python/scripts/) written as python scripts and read the [tutorials](learn-python/tutorials) written in markdown format.

I document Python topics here as I learn and explore, so that I have an easy reference or how-to guide for myself or anyone else who might be interested.

If you want to contribute, I welcome any corrections or enhancements.
