## What is Github?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub): 

> GitHub, Inc. is a US-based global company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git. ... It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
>
> ... Free GitHub accounts are commonly used to host open source projects.


What can you do with it? Here are a few things, copied from [Quickstart](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart) docs:

> - **Setup git** - At the heart of GitHub is an open source version control system (VCS) called Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer.
> - **Create a repo** - To put your project up on GitHub, you'll need to create a repository for it to live in.
> - **Fork a repo** - A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
> - **Be social** - You can interact with people, repositories, and organizations on GitHub. See what others are working on and who they're connecting with from your personal dashboard.
