A release is a way of bundling a snapshot of your software and packaging and distributing it for other people to use.

From the docs:

> You can create a release to package software, along with release notes and links to binary files, for other people to use.
>
> Releases are deployable software iterations you can package and make available for a wider audience to download and use.
> Releases are based on _Git tags_, which mark a specific point in your repository's history. A tag date may be different than a release date since they can be created at different times. ...
