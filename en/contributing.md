## Request a change

Create an issue. Let's discuss details there.

Not all issues will get done or may take time to get to. This project only has one main maintainer.


## Steps to contribute

If you want to have a conversation about changes first, create an issue and we can discuss there. For simpler changes, just go right ahead to make changes and a Pull Request as below.

1. Fork the project.
2. Make your changes to markdown or code files.
    - Optionally use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) to edit content. It let's you preview the rendered output in the browser. It works great on markdown files and in larger repos.
3. Check your changes.
    - Make sure files and directories follow the convention in the rest of the project.
    - Markdown - Make sure your changed pages render in GitHub and links work.
    - Scripts - Make sure they run.
4. Add your name to the list in the next section.
5. Create a Pull Request for the original repo. There is no template for a Pull Request.
