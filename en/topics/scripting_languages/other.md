    > A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- Description: Note this is not new programming language. It is a modern and more secure way of distributing and running Node apps - without a package file in development (packages are inferred from imports) and with a single binary executable as output. "Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust." Version [1.0](https://deno.land/v1) was released in 2020. It is a runtime environment for running JavaScript and TypeScript and compiles to a single binary executable - no package installation is needed to run it. I can recommend this 15 min intro video. https://youtu.be/zFf_fcn0cI0
