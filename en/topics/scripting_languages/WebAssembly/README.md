# WebAssembly

## What is WebAssembly?

Or "WASM" for short.

- A modern language which is great at high-performance operations in the browser, without having to write JavaScript.
- You can code in another language and get Web Assembly as the output. 
- WebAssembly can be loaded as a module in the browser, so you can get the benefit of the performance without writing WebAssembly yourself.

    > WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

  > WebAssembly is an open standard that defines a portable binary-code format for executable programs, and a corresponding textual assembly language, as well as interfaces for facilitating interactions between such programs and their host environment.

	> WebAssembly is a new type of code that can be run in modern web browsers â€” it is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++ and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web.
	> 
	> It is also designed to run alongside JavaScript, allowing both to work together.


Extensions:
