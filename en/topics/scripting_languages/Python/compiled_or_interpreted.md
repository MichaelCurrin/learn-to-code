# Is Python compiled or interpreted?

Python is not compiled to machine code like C or Go.

Python is compiled to **byte code**. That is then executed by the Python **interpreter**. You can see the byte code in form of the `.pyc` files which are generated when importing modules but not when executing a script directly.
