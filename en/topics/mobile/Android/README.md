Note that Java is not used in this section.

Conent is based mostly on a [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com) course.

The XML scripts can be run in the [Android Visualizer](http://labs.udacity.com/android-visualizer/) in order to reference the resources there.

See the Common Android Views [cheat sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5XIkMkayHgRMVljUVIyZzNmQUU/view).
