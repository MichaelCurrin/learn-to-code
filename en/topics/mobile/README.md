If you are interested in mobile development, here is what you should know about language choices available.


### Native

- Android development is based on one of these (or a mix)
    - XML
    - Java
    - Kotlin (more modern and Google uses this rather than Java)
- iOS development is based on one of these:
    - Objective-C
    - Swift (more modern and replaces Objective-C)
     
### Cross-platform

Write code once and compile to native code for Android and iOS.
