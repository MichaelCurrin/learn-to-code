With info from StackOverflow answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/572549/difference-between-git-add-a-and-git-add).


Stage only new files.

```bash
$ git add .
```

Stage modified and deleted files using update flag.

```bash
git add -u stages modified or deleted, excluding new.
```

Stage everything

```bash
$ git add -A
```
