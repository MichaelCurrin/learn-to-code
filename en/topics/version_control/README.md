# Version control

This section covers managing your source code with a Version Control System (VCS), such that you can maintain code history, authorship and branches of your projects. 

This also allows you put your code online as a backup, for the public to see or for your team of developers in your organization to work on privately. While the tools used are based in the command-line, there are often web services, desktop applications and IDE extensions to make managing code easier.


## Summary of git and Github

> GitHub is an online service based on Git, a code versioning system developed by Linux creator Linus Torvalds. Git lets developers take snapshots of files in their software development projects, enabling them to revert their changes later or create different branches of a project for different people to work on. GitHub lets them ‘push’ copies of those repositories to its online service so that other developers can download (clone) and work on them too.

## Code hosting services

You can use an online service to interact with a `git` repository and use that service to share your work publically or in a private team. A public project can optionally allow open-source contributions from the dev community.

These services usually the following features:

- You can view and manage repos, including editing code.
- Users can be managed.
- Works with `git` version control. 
- Available for free, with additional benefits on subscription.

See details of services below.


### Github

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. Mostly it is used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, as well as adding its own features. Such as reviewing the code of other contributors.
