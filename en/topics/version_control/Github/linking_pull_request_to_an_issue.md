# Linking a pull request to an issue

You can link a PR to an issue by updating the section in the bottom right of a PR or issue page.

You can also use [closing keywords](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

e.g. In a PR description, link to an issue, which will be marked as closed when the PR is merged.
