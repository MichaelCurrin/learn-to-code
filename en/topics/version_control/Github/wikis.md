# Wikis

A Wiki can be enabled as markdown documentation for a repo.

Enable in repo settings.

Then find as a Wiki tab.

Note that if your repo is open to edits from collaborators, the Wiki is editable to. This is less controlled - any GitHub users can make changes, you will not get notifications such as by email and there are no Pull Requests.

You can also see revisions of a page so you can revert.

You can also clone a wiki using the URL on the Wiki page, then add markdown page updates or even add scripts which are not shown on the frontend.

The Wiki's commits are independent of the main repo - this can be a problem if you want to keep documentation in sync with the code.

A Wiki can be create for non-developers who want to see how web API endpoints work. A Wiki is also an alternative or similar to a docs folder or a docs website.

Styling is limited on a Wiki - it stays as the GitHub black and white look.

Markdown syntax is a slightly different for a Wiki.

Wiki does not come with a repo when forked.
