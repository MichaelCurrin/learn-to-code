## Tools

## IDE extensions

### VS Code

#### Formatting

These work great for making HTML and JS look neat and all your files consistently spaced.

- Beautify
- Prettier
- Markdown All in One


I found memory leaks with this on saving an HTML file with comments, especially with TODOs. VS Code would take up around 90% memory when there is a comment in the HTML. So far I've seen this in Beautify in HTML and Markdown All in One in Markdown - so maybe it is a VS Code and not an extension issue.
