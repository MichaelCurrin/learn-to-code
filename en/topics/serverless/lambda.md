## What is Lambda?

From [What is AWS Lambda?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-nodejs.html) in the AWS docs:

> AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. 
>
> With AWS Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. AWS Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging.
>
> All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that AWS Lambda supports.
