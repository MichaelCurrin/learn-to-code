## Implementation

Most programming language you come across such as Bash, Python or Java will be implemented in _C_. 

For example, if you look at Python on Github ([python/cpython](https://github.com/python/cpython)), you will see many files written in _C_. When you run Python code or import a builtin library, you might be running compiled _C_ code directory or you might be running _Python_ code which internally runs _C_ code. Running _C_ directly is typically mich faster, as running Python code requires interpretation and compilation at runtime.
