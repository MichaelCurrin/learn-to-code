# Python

## What is Python?

Python is an elegant, easy to ready language. It was named after _Monty Python_.

It can be used for functional and object-oriented programming.

In Python, to separate logical blocks in conditionals and loops we use indentation (typically 4 spaces at a time) rather than curly brackets as in C, Java or JavaScript.

Python has a rich friendly growing community. 

Python is a weakly and dynamically typed language i.e. A variable can also change data types (though this can cause headaches when catching bugs, so adding type checking is useful) and you do not need to specify the data type of a variable as this can be inferred and is checked at runtime not compile time.

### Libraries

Python libraries are usually stored on the Python Package Index (PyPI) - [link](https://pypi.org/).

There are many Python libraries available for download for free. You can use some as standup applications. Some can be imported in your projects. Python projects are typically open source, so you can modify an existing project, using it as a starting point for your project or modifying a library you need to import as the original one is lacking something.

### Common usecases for Python

- Once-off short scripts
- Automating repetive tasks
- Web servers
- Web scraping
- Data science (fetching, processing and visualizing data)
- Machine learning
- Games on desktop

Python can even be used for mobile apps and build a static website.

One web server appoach is Wordpress style - generate HTML from templates and use a database for fetching and store user data. 

Another approach is create an API which processes web requests and return serves JSON data for use by a web frontend or mobile apps.
