# Python for Data Sciencists

If you want to use Python for Data Science proejct, I recommend installing [Anaconda](#anaconda) and/or [Conda](#conda), covered below. These are popular tools for setting up environments with specific Python versions and packages and then running the code. In particular, the programs that come with Anaconda help with development, debuggin and viewing in the output of the code close to the code.


## Anaconda

### What is Anaconda?

Anaconda is a platform which makes it easy to setup an environment for running Python (and other languages like R).

It includes things to save you install them, such as:

- Open source Python libraries
- Programs 
    - Jupyter 
        - Run Jupyter Notebooks (aka iPython Notebooks) - these include markdown, code and output (text and graphics) and so are ideal for iterating on code and presenting results.
        - [jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org/)
            > Project Jupyter exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.
    - Spyder IDE 
        - [spyder-ide.org](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
            - IDE for running and debugging code interactively and presenting results.
            > Spyder is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts.
    - Conda 
        - Command-line tool for managing Python libraries inside virtual environments.
        - [docs.conda.io](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
            > Package, dependency and environment management for any languageâ€”Python, R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C/ C++, FORTRAN, and more.

There is an enterprise version and a free version known as "Anaconda Distribution".

> Anaconda Distribution is a free, easy-to-install package manager, environment manager, and Python distribution with a collection of 1,500+ open source packages with free community support. Anaconda is platform-agnostic, so you can use it whether you are on Windows, macOS, or Linux. [source](https://docs.anaconda.com)

### Install

How to install Anaconda Distribution

- [Installation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) doc


## Conda

Conda is for managing virtual environments. You can install it alone, without Anaconda.

Conda is similar to `pip`. Conda references its own index packages of mostly Data Science packages, while pip references PyPI. 

_Note: I found it frustrating when trying install things with Conda that are missing but available on `pip`, so that's one reason I prefer `pip`, but there might be ways around this._

### Installation

- [Installation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) instructions in the User guide doc.

### Usage

- [User guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html) doc.

Below are some highlights from the [Getting Started](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) page. Note, only the macOS / Linux instructions are covered below - the Windows instructions are slightly different.

#### Check installed version

```sh
$ conda --version
```

```sh
$ conda update conda
```

#### Why virtual environments?

A virtual environment is a disposable sandboxed location to install libraries, usually for a specific project. This means that you can recreate the same environment (set of Python libraries with locked version) on other machines, whether on your other laptop, a colleagues machine or production server. 

This also avoids conflicts. For example, say you have two projects (Python applications) both use the base conda environment. The one needs `requests` version `2.0.0` and the other needs `3.0.0`. But you can only have one version of `requests` installed in an environment. So one of the projects will not work. So you can create two virtual environments - one with `2.0.0` and one with `3.0.0`. You change libraries in a virtual environment and only affect that one project.

#### Manage virtual environments

He we create a virtual environment with a given name and optional list of libaries to install, then activate it, check what is installed and then activate the base. 

```sh
$ conda create --name snowflakes biopython

$ conda activate snowflakes
(snowflakes) $
(snowflakes) $ conda info --envs
conda environments:

    base           /home/username/Anaconda3
    snowflakes   * /home/username/Anaconda3/envs/snowflakes

$ conda activate
$
```

#### Manage Python

```sh
$ conda create --name snakes python=3.5

$ conda activate snakes
(snakes) $

(snakes) $  conda info --envs
...

(snakes) $ python --version
...

(snakes) $ conda activate
$
```

#### Managing packages

Install a Python package/library with a virtual environment. 

```sh
$ conda search beautifulsoup4
```

```sh
$ conda install beautifulsoup4
```

```sh
$ conda list
```
