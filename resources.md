### üí° Software design concepts

- Functional programming
- [Object-orientated programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
- [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles for Object-orientated programming
    - Single responsibility principle
    - Open-close principle
    - Liskov substitution principle
    - Interface segregation principle
- Databases
    - SQL

    - ORM
- Web application design
    - RESTful API
    - [GraphQL](GraphQL/) API
    - Model View Controller (MVC)
    - Server-side rendering (SSR)
        - Such as PHP and Python applications.
    - Client-side rendering (CSR), such JavaScript Single-Page Application (SPA)
    - Single-page application

### ‚ÜîÔ∏è Backend vs frontend

See a blog post I wrote [here](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/coding-blog/2020/02/20/backend-vs-frontend.html) which explains the difference between these two areas.

### üå∏ Design patterns

> In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)

- [Design Patterns](/Scripting%20languages/Python/README.md#design-patterns) in Python.
- [Design Patterns in Java Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/index.htm) on Tutorials Point website - the the patterns listed on the sidebar menu there.

### üèü Architecture

- [Software Architecture Fundamentals](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/software-architecture-fundamentals/9781491998991/9781491998991-video316989) on O‚ÄôReilly Online Learning. 9 hour course.

#### üóº Domain driven design

- [Domain-Driven Design Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/domain-driven-design-fundamentals/table-of-contents) on Pluralsight. 4 hour course.
- [Software Architecture - Domain Driven Design](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/software-architecture-domain-driven-design/) on LinkedIn Learning. 1 hour course.

### üõ£ Roadmaps

Don't know where to start? Pick a roadmap (learning path) based on your chosen direction.

- [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/). Github: [kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)

### üîÅ Rosetta code

The [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/) website provides tasks solved in various languages for easy comparison. This can be useful whether you are a new or familar with a language. The examples here tend to be minimal and follow a similar pattern, for example if you understand what the Python one is doing you can make sense of the equivalent logic in Ruby or PHP.

Topics:

- [Hello world text](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Text)
- Web
    - [Web server](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Web_server) hello world
    - [Web scraping](https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Web_scraping)
    - [HTTPS/Auth](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/HTTPS/Authenticated)

See also, "Hello, world" program on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program).

### üìè Test Driven Development

- [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) on Wikipedia.
- [kata-bootstraps](https://github.com/swkBerlin/kata-bootstraps) - If you are interested in writing unit tests, you might find some bootstrap code here for a certain language.
- [Test Driven Development (TDD): Example Walkthrough](https://technologyconversations.com/2013/12/20/test-driven-development-tdd-example-walkthrough/) blog post.
- [Introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD)](http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html) essay on Agile Data website.

### üñå Code style

Learn how to write code that follows the style guide for the language or project/team.

- [Programming style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_style)
- [Why coding style matters](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/why-coding-style-matters/) blog post
- [Style guides for Google-originated open-source projects](https://github.com/google/styleguide)

### üîç Code review

Learn to review other developers' code.

- [Code review skills for people](https://speakerdeck.com/nnja/code-review-skills-for-people) slide deck.
- [Code review](https://github.com/features/code-review/) feature guide Github.
